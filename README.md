## Introduction 
Generative AI in computer vision is revolutionizing productivity by automating visual content creation through intelligent algorithms that can generate high-quality images and videos rapidly and efficiently. 

Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is a branch of AI that employs machine learning models to produce novel data resembling the training dataset.
It can create text, images, audio, or even video content by predicting what comes next in a sequence based on patterns learned during training.

## Here we have worked with OpenCv
## What is OpenCV?

- Open Source Computer Vision Library, is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library.
- Initially developed by Intel, OpenCV is a free cross-platform computer vision library for real-time image processing.
- OpenCV is written in C and C++. It runs under the most popular operating systems, such as GNU/Linux, OS X, Windows, Android, iOS, etc.
- OpenCV has even been used in sound and music recognition, where vision recognition techniques have been applied to sound spectrogram images.

### various operations in the image. :
   - Read the Image 
   - Image Enhacncement 
   - Object detection
   - Image Filtering
   - Draw the Image
   - Saving the Changed Images

## What is Computer Vision? 
Computer vision is a primary field of Artificial Intelligence technology that allows computers to extract information from digital images and videos to take specific actions. While there are different definitions of Artificial Intelligence (AI), all concepts generally focus on replicating human intelligence with machines.

## How does computer vision work?
The technologies of machine vision aim to imitate human vision; it involves the interpretation of digital images or videos for understanding and recognizing objects and scenes in them. This is achieved through a combination of software and hardware that mimics the workings of the human visual system. Some common methods used in machine vision are pattern recognition, feature extraction, and image processing.

AI vision, or Computer Vision, involves a set of image-processing techniques to make computers see and understand visual information. Computers act as “the brains” that perform advanced computing tasks and apply sophisticated algorithms to analyze images or videos provided by optical sensors or cameras (the “eyes”). Virtually any image of any camera can be used to apply AI vision algorithms.
